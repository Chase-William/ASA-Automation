## Functions üìú
Listed below are all the functions or scripts supported in this application.

<a name="autoClicker"></a>
### Auto Clicker üñ±Ô∏è

By default performs a left click at a specified interval, but can be configured to send keystrokes instead. To send keystrokes, set a keystroke in the *keystroke* hotkey box labeled *Keystroke*. To return to default left click functionality, clear *Keystroke* input and set.

#### Example use cases:

1. Use default to level tank dino health
2. Use keystroke `A` to afk spam craft
3. Use kstroke `E` to afk spam heal carnivore by feeding raw meat

- ü©π **AutoBrew**, consume med brews
- ü•û **AutoEat**, consume hunger based consumable

<a name="autoFertilizer"></a>
### Auto Fertilizer üí©

Produce slot caps of fertilizer by using a irrigated toilet. Character must be ready to defecate and be seated on an irrigated toilet.

# Options & Supporting Functionalities

<a name="change_autoclick_interval"></a>
### AutoClicker Interval

To change the auto click interval follow these steps:

1. Open `config.ini`.
2. Find *autoClickInterval* under the *[delay]* section.
3. Replace the default *50* with your interval in milliseconds.

<a name="functionInterrupt"></a>
### Function Interrupt ‚èØÔ∏è
To make functions easier to use, they should be pauseable, resumeable, and replaceable to allow:

1. Prevent unwanted function execution overlap
2. Prevent user request being placed in a queue delaying execution
3. Allow long running and quick task to work together
  
Therefore, the interrupt logic table has been defined below.

#### Interruptible & Resumable Functions
Functions that can be momentarily paused while another functions executes and later resumed afterwards automatically.

1. Auto Clicker
2. Metal Farm
3. Auto Brew
4. Auto Eat
5. Auto Drink

#### Interruptable & Replaceable Functions
Functions that can be interrupted *(execution terminates)* and be replaced by another.

1. Handle Metal Farm Junk, *(only effected by Auto Clicker)*

#### Uninterruptable Functions
Functions that cannot be interrupted by other functions and therefore, can only be enabled/disabled directly.

1. Bot *(omitted from default application)*
2. Paste Farm *(omitted from default application)*
3. Suicide Farm *(omitted from default application)*
4. Fert Farm
5. Take All
6. Give All
7. Self Drop All
8. Other Drop All
   
#### Catalyst Functions
Functions that can interrupt other functions or fail to execute if an uninterruptable function is currently active.

1. Take All
2. Give All
3. Self Drop All
4. Other Drop All
5. Handle Metal Farm Junk

## Developer Notes

A function ending in `Safe` means it has built in mechanics to ensure the desired state is reached before returning.

## OMITTED FROM GENERAL RELEASE

### Auto Self Meat Farm

Produce meat by suiciding over campfires constantly.

> Ensure Meat Farm Beds poisition is set to your beds to respawn at. I tried using image search and other options for automatically finding the beds after a query, but because of the large amount of iterations of this function; a fool proof approach was needed.
